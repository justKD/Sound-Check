# Sound-Check
 
Developed in MaxMSP, this standalone application can be used to send sound signals to any combination of up to 64 channels in order to test channel assignment and sound quality/levels.

Sound Check is due for a major update and as such is not guaranteed to be supported for any particular devices or setup. The .app provided in this repo is MacOS only.
